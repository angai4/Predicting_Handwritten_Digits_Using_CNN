# Predicting Handwritten Digits Using CNN
*Building the Original LeNet5 Architecture*

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train the classical convolutional neural network architecture LeNet‑5 for the task of handwritten digit classification (e.g., on the MNIST dataset). The notebook 'Building_The_Original_LeNet5.ipynb' walks through the end-to-end process: data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation of results.

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow
- GPU is helpful
